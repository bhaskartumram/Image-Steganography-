# Image-Steganography-
The image steganography is implemented using Matlab. In this project LSB technique is used. We read cover image and secret message image and resize both images. Rearrange each frame into binary bit stream pattern (RGB) for both cover and secret message image file. Now HSBs (first two) of secret image are embedded in LSB position of cove image. All frames embedded together and generates a stegno image.
